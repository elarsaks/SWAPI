# Images

I couldn't find any good APIs to get the images, but I discovered a Kaggle dataset. It was a 14GB collection of character images, sorted into folders named after the characters. I requested a Python script from GPT to retrieve the first image from each folder and rename the image after the folder. Then, I uploaded those images into an S3 bucket and used them from there.

## Images
Since there was no images provided and I couldn't find any good APIs for the images:
- Downloaded a 1.4GB dataset from Kaggle containing character images.
- Used a script from ChatGPT to retrieve and rename one image per character.
- Uploaded images into S3 bucket
- Discovered that this dataset didnt have all the characters and left the image loading failure in as a feature
